Script will install most important programs from programmer point of view. Script is designed to work with fresh Ubuntu. If you have previous programs installed this script is not optimised on this. Make sure you will uninstall previous versions.

Script will be rewritten in Python to increase fuinctionality in the future however I use bash for this. I also used "zenity" for better GUI
